# Abstract

This course is a continuation of the lecture "Symbolic Programming Language". The main goal is to approach more challenging NLP tasks than what we have done so far. These tasks will be in the form of shared tasks (similar to the task on POS tagging we had at the end of last semester), which are an important part of state-of-the-art CL research. With the use of Python and NLTK we will make use of text classification techniques in order to tackle problems, such as Sentiment Analysis, Parsing/Chunking, Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Analysis, Word Sense Disambiguation and Coreference Resolution..

This course is conducted at LMU Munich.
